## What It Does

Authoring-term note:

- framework 作者源中的 `Boundary` 现统一改称 `Parameter`
- 当前 canonical / runtime 为兼容既有主链，仍保留 `boundary_id`、`boundary projection` 等历史机器字段名

- Opens the framework tree and workspace evidence tree from the sidebar.
- Clicks on the Shelf status bar item can open the framework tree directly (configurable).
- Treats the repository mainline as:
  `Framework -> Config -> Code -> Evidence`.
- Treats `projects/*/generated/canonical.json` as the only machine truth.
- Treats framework tree and evidence tree as canonical-derived views.
- Supports framework-markdown navigation for `B/C/R/V`, parameters, module refs, and rule refs.
- Maps framework parameters back to `projects/*/project.toml` sections such as `[exact.knowledge_base.chat]` and `[exact.frontend.surface]`.
- Auto-materializes affected projects when `framework/*.md` or `projects/*/project.toml` changes.
- Guards `projects/*/generated/*` from direct edits.
- Treats stale / missing / invalid canonical as non-authoritative: formal config jumps and the evidence tree wait for fresh canonical.
- Runs canonical validation and optionally `mypy` from the extension.
- Adds project-independent framework markdown syntax diagnostics (Problems 波浪线) while typing/saving.
- Adds context-aware framework markdown completion (section-aware + auto-number defaults) and lint Quick Fix actions.
- Supports publishing the active `framework_drafts/...` file into the formal `framework/...` tree.
- Adds a governed-task intent gate: map request text to canonical framework paths (`module_id / boundary_id / exact.*`) before implementation.
- Enforces one-to-one parameter mapping for governed-task sessions: if any canonical parameter still projects to multiple related paths, session grant is rejected until framework is clarified.
- Save-time blocking is disabled; repository-side validation/hook checks remain the enforcement boundary.

## Configuration

Local workspace overlay file:

- `.shelf/settings.jsonc`
- VSCode `shelf.*` setting has highest priority; `.shelf/settings.jsonc` is used when no explicit VSCode value is set.
- `.shelf/settings.jsonc` can use JSONC comments and is intended for repository-visible local tuning.

- `shelf.guardMode = strict`
- `shelf.showMessagePopups = true`
- `shelf.intentGateEnabled = true`
- `shelf.intentGateRequireMappingEcho = true`
- `shelf.intentGateRunChangeValidationBeforeGrant = true`
- `shelf.intentGateAutoOpenOutput = true`
- `shelf.intentGateMinimumScore = 4`
- `shelf.intentGateMaxMatches = 8`
- `shelf.intentGateSessionTtlMinutes = 120`
- `shelf.intentGateTemporaryBypasses = []`
- `shelf.frameworkTreeNodeHorizontalGap = 8`
- `shelf.frameworkTreeLevelVerticalGap = 80`
- `shelf.frameworkTreeAutoRefreshOnSave = true`
- `shelf.statusBarClickAction = openFrameworkTree`
- `shelf.treeZoomMinScale = 0.68`
- `shelf.treeZoomMaxScale = 1.55`
- `shelf.treeWheelSensitivity = 1`
- `shelf.treeInspectorWidth = 338`
- `shelf.treeInspectorRailWidth = 42`
- `shelf.validationCommandTimeoutMs = 120000`
- `shelf.generatedEventSuppressionMs = 2500`
- `shelf.manualValidationRestartThresholdMs = 15000`
- `shelf.validationDebounceMs = 250`
- `shelf.frameworkLintEnabled = true`
- `shelf.frameworkLintOnType = true`
- `shelf.frameworkLintDebounceMs = 300`
- `shelf.frameworkAutoCompleteEnabled = true`
- `shelf.frameworkAutoTriggerSuggest = true`
- `shelf.frameworkQuickFixEnabled = true`

Changing tree webview settings will re-render the currently open tree panel automatically. If no tree panel is open, the next open/refresh will use the new values. Validation timing settings take effect on the next scheduled or manual validation run without requiring reload. Framework lint/completion/quick-fix settings take effect immediately for currently opened framework markdown files.

Notification popup behavior:

- `shelf.showMessagePopups = true`: keep Shelf right-corner popup messages enabled.
- `shelf.showMessagePopups = false`: suppress popup interruptions while keeping Output logs, status-bar state, and Problems signals available.

Framework tree behavior settings:

- `shelf.frameworkTreeAutoRefreshOnSave = true`:
  after framework markdown is saved, Shelf runs save-time change validation/materialization first, then refreshes an open framework tree.
  when full materialization fails and the materialize command uses `scripts/materialize_project.py`, Shelf enables `--allow-framework-only-fallback` to refresh `canonical.framework` snapshot first.
- `shelf.statusBarClickAction = openFrameworkTree`:
  clicking Shelf status bar opens the framework tree panel (floating/dockable/resizable webview tab).
- `shelf.statusBarClickAction = quickPick`:
  clicking Shelf status bar first shows two explicit choices: open framework tree or show issues.

Intent-gate temporary bypass supports multi-option configuration:

- Keep strict mode: `[]`
- Bypass specific checks: for example `["grant_pre_validation", "mapping_echo"]`
- Bypass all listed checks: `["*"]`

Available bypass items:

- `grant_pre_validation`: skip `validate_canonical.py --check-changes` before session grant.
- `mapping_echo`: skip QuickPick mapping confirmation before session grant.
- `one_to_one_check`: allow governed-task session mapping even when canonical boundary projection is not one-to-one.

`one_to_one_check` only affects local plugin session grant behavior; repository-level `validate_canonical.py` one-to-one checks still apply.

## Governed Task Flow

1. Run `Shelf: Start Governed Task`.
2. Enter the requested change text.
3. Shelf runs `validate_canonical.py --check-changes` (configurable), computes canonical-backed mapping candidates, and asks for confirmation.
   If canonical boundary projection is not one-to-one, Shelf blocks the session and asks a human to update framework first (unless `one_to_one_check` temporary bypass is enabled).
   You can temporarily bypass specific gate steps with `shelf.intentGateTemporaryBypasses`, but default remains strict.
4. Once granted, the session remains available until it expires or is cleared.
5. Save-time blocking is disabled; guard enforcement relies on repository validation and git hooks at commit/push boundaries.

## Validation

Default commands:

- `uv run python scripts/validate_canonical.py --check-changes`
- `uv run python scripts/validate_canonical.py`
- `uv run python scripts/materialize_project.py`
- `uv run mypy`

`validate_canonical.py` now enforces one-to-one boundary projection at repository guard level. If any boundary still maps to multiple related paths, validation fails with `FRAMEWORK_VIOLATION` and asks for framework updates first.

`Shelf: Run Codegen Preflight` materializes all discovered `projects/*/project.toml` files, then runs full validation.

Framework markdown lint is independent from project selection: syntax diagnostics are computed directly from the current `framework/**` or `framework_drafts/**` document and rendered as standard VSCode Problems diagnostics.
The same diagnostics expose Quick Fix actions (lightbulb) for common formatting mistakes, including list marker normalization, missing `@framework`, missing standard sections, and invalid C/P/B/R/V entry formatting.

The `@framework` template entry is a repository-side hard authoring contract and must not be removed without an equally direct replacement.

## Tree Views

The framework tree is the authoring view.
The evidence tree is the canonical-derived workspace evidence view.
No persisted tree artifact is used for these views; both trees are runtime projections.
Both tree views render as interactive webview graphs (dagre layout + d3-zoom runtime interaction), and framework nodes stay layer-fixed with layout-engine auto sorting.
Tree interactions include search, upstream/downstream focus, keyboard navigation (arrow keys + Enter), and viewport/selection state persistence.
The framework tree is canonical-projected; framework markdown saves should materialize canonical before tree refresh.
When canonical is stale, missing, or invalid, Shelf blocks the formal evidence tree until you materialize again.
Framework-only fallback snapshots are marked as degraded materialization state, so evidence tree remains blocked until the next full materialization succeeds.

## Project Config Navigation

Boundary jumps now target unified project config sections, for example:

- `[exact.frontend.surface]`
- `[exact.frontend.visual]`
- `[exact.knowledge_base.chat]`
- `[exact.knowledge_base.library]`
- `[exact.knowledge_base.preview]`
- `[exact.knowledge_base.return]`

The extension no longer treats the removed dual-track config files as live authoring entrypoints.
